üõçÔ∏è Ecommerce Orders Dashboard (Power BI Project)
This repository hosts a comprehensive Ecommerce Orders Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to provide strategic insights into global sales performance, customer behavior, and order management efficiency for an international ecommerce business.

üéØ Dashboard Overview
The primary goal of this dashboard is to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify areas for sales improvement.

Key Metrics & Findings:
Sales Attainment: A high-level view shows total sales of $489,267 against a target of $273,020 (for certain countries), but overall tracking reveals a significant variance of -21.70K (a -21.73% deviation from the $450.00K goal).

Performance by Team: Detailed comparison of Sum of 2023 Sales Target and Sum of Sales by Full Name/Sales Team to benchmark individual and team performance.

Geographic Analysis: Order counts and average order values are mapped across continents, including North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, providing regional performance context.

Customer Profiling: Insights into customer demographics, including the Count of Customer ID by Category and Gender (Categories A, B, C, D, E), and analysis of preferred Order Sources (App, Website/etc.).

Sales Cycle Efficiency: Tracking of the Count of Sales POC by Target Bucket to monitor pipeline velocity and conversion stages.

Temporal Trends: Visualization of the Sum of Order Value and Count of Order ID by Month to identify seasonality and monthly fluctuations in demand.
